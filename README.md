TikTrendz is a video analysis and statistics platform based on TikTok. Our aim is to provide a platform where users can discover trending videos, analyze trends, view videos by category, and analyze comments.

## Features

1. **Trending Video Aggregation**: Our platform collects trending videos on TikTok and aggregates them for easy viewing and analysis.

2. **Trend Analysis**: Our platform analyzes trends on TikTok and provides detailed reports to help users understand what content is currently popular.

3. **Categorized Video Aggregation**: Our platform collects and aggregates videos according to various categories (such as music, dance, comedy, etc.) to allow users to easily find content they are interested in.

4. **Comment Analysis**: Our platform analyzes comments on TikTok to help users understand public reactions and sentiments.

## Technology Stack:

* Front End: HTML, CSS, Javascript(jQuery AJAX)  
* Back End: Express.js 
* DB: MySQL 
* Blockchain: Ethereum
* CVS: Github 
* Teamwork: Github Project, Github Wiki, face-to-face meeting 

The front end, developed using jQuery, will provide a user-friendly interface for consumers, retailers, and producers to interact with the system. The back end, developed using Express.js, will handle the communication between the front end, the MySQL database, and the blockchain. The MySQL database will be used for storing non-blockchain related data.
