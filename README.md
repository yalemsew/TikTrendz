# Traceability-System
Organic Apple Traceability System

## Background:
With the increasing demand for organic produce, the need for transparent and reliable traceability systems has become more critical than ever. Consumers want to be assured of the origin and quality of their food, and retailers want to ensure the authenticity of the organic produce they sell. This project aims to develop a blockchain-based traceability system for organic apples, utilizing Ethereum and IPFS technologies to create a decentralized, immutable, and transparent system.

## Problem:
Existing traceability systems often rely on centralized databases that are vulnerable to manipulation and lack transparency. This creates a trust issue between consumers, retailers, and producers. Additionally, these systems often have difficulties handling large volumes of data and ensuring its integrity over time.

## Solution:
The proposed system will use Ethereum to record transactions and IPFS to store relevant data, such as inspection reports, organic certifications, and harvest details. Each apple batch will be given a unique identifier, which will be linked to its data on the IPFS and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. This will ensure that the data is immutable and transparent.

## Technology Stack:

* Front End: HTML, CSS, Javascript(jQuery AJAX)  
* Back End: Express.js 
* DB: MySQL, IPFS 
* Blockchain: Ethereum
* CVS: Github 
* Teamwork: Github Project, Github Wiki, face-to-face meeting 

The front end, developed using jQuery, will provide a user-friendly interface for consumers, retailers, and producers to interact with the system. The back end, developed using Express.js, will handle the communication between the front end, the MySQL database, and the blockchain. The MySQL database will be used for storing non-blockchain related data.

## Functionality and Features:
The system will allow users to:

Register new batches of apples, with details about the harvest, organic certification, and other relevant data.
Trace a batch of apples back to its origin, viewing all related data.
Verify the authenticity of a batch of apples, confirming its organic certification and other details.

## Expected Outcomes:
The successful implementation of this system will provide a reliable and transparent traceability solution for organic apples. It will enhance consumer trust, ensure the authenticity of organic produce, and potentially pave the way for the application of blockchain technology in other areas of the food industry.
